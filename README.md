Usage: 

python3 main.py filename


Goal:

To create a classifer to classify animal behavior graphs into
one of five different animal behaviour archetypes:

Presociality (solitary animal)
Subsociality (parents interact only with young)
Solitary but Social (adults forage alone but share common space)
Parasociality (two generations live in same space)
Eusociality (3+ generations live in same space)


The data for this project can be found at:

This will be achieved using a custom pytorch neural network model
using featurized versions of the graphs.
